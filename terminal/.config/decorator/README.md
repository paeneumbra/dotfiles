# Decorator

This is simple setup to change my environment color scheme,
mostly from dark to light and vice-versa.

Applications the scripts can update:

- Alacritty
- Rofi (rasi theme)
- Xresources (urxvt, polybar)

There is a tight coupling between the color scheme files generated by the
decorator scripts and the system configuration files.

**WARN:** Applications _NOT_ supported.

- gtk
- qt
- vim/neovim
- firefox
- wezterm
- zathura

## Warning

This is far from optimal and it's a WIP.
It's a on going process that might change without notice.

## Usage examples

```shell
decorate -s /home/archy/.config/decorator/colourschemes/gruvbox-dark.json
```

```shell
decorate -c nordic
```

```shell
decorate -d
```

```shell
decorate --list
```

## Neovim

The file `palette.lua` could be used for nvim, however the extra color will break the colorscheme if it's a lighter tone.

It's a WIP.
